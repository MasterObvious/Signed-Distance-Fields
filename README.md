# Signed-Distance-Fields
An implementation of real-time Signed Distance Fields in Java. This project was completed as part of my Further Graphics course in first year.

Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) work in a similar way to ray tracing but instead of directly calculating the intersect from the vector of the ray, we instead calculate the minimum distance the ray could travel from a particular point before it might hit an object in the scene. If this distance is negative, then we must be intersecting with an object. SDFs can be manipulated in ways that would be far too complex for other methods; this is why they were used for the film _Doctor Strange_

If you use each of the GLSL files, you get these images:
